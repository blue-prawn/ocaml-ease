=== How to compile and install ===

0) Go in the directory of the implementation that you want:
$ cd src-float/
$ cd src-int/

1) to compile the sources to bytecode:
$ make lib

2) to compile the sources to native code:
$ make opt

3) install using findlib (requires that you already installed it):
$ make findinstall
